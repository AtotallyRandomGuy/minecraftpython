# MCPY
Minecraft, but made in Python 3 and pyglet.


To run, install pyglet and Python 3.
Go the the project's directory and open a terminal or command prompt.

Or run the compiled binaries in the releases page. No Mac binary because I don't give my weekly paycheck to Apple. 
If you want to compile one for the project, contact me.

# macOS and Linux
python3 minecraft.py

# Windows
py minecraft.py
